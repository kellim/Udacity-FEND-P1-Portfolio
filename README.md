# Udacity Portfolio Site

This was the first project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, a portfolio site to showcase my Udacity projects. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create the portfolio page based on a provided design mockup. 

This was an early Portfolio site that now shows a few Front-End Udacity projects, but it's not kept up to date. It's no longer available online. You can visit my website at [kelliblalock.com](https://kelliblalock.com) instead.

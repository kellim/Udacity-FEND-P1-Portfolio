# Udacity Portfolio Site

This was the first project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, a portfolio site to showcase my Udacity projects. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create the portfolio page based on a provided design mockup. 

This was an early Portfolio site that now shows a few Front-End Udacity projects, but it's not kept up to date and is no longer available online. If interested, you can download the files to view it and open `index.html`. 

However, if you're interested in my more current projects, visit my website at [kelliblalock.com](https://kelliblalock.com).

# Portfolio Project
This is the first project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree, a portfolio site to showcase my Udacity projects. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create the portfolio page based on a provided design mockup. The original project was completed in 2015, and it has since had additional projects added to it.
